# MNIST-Recognize-Handwritten-Digits

Handwritten digit recognition is the process to provide the ability to machines to recognize human handwritten digits.

To implement this we will use a type of deep neural network called Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Dataset-
MNIST is the most popular dataset for enthusiasts of machine learning and deep learning. Above 60,000 plus training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and more than 10,000 images for testing are present in the MNIST dataset. So, 10 different classes are in the MNIST dataset. The images of handwritten digits are shown as a matrix of 28Ã—28 where every cell consists of a grayscale pixel value.
